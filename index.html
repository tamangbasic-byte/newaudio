  <p>TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 16 (BHADRA 31) “IF, WHEN YOU DO GOOD AND SUFFER AND TAKE IT PATIENTLY, YOU ENDURE IT, THIS IS COMMENDABLE IN GOD’S SIGHT.” – 1 PETER 2:20 ACCEPT LIFE’S STRUGGLES ¤ HAVE YOU LEARNED FROM EXPERIENCING HARDSHIP? DO YOU FIND YOURSELF WONDERING, “WHY AM I GOING THROUGH THIS?” BECAUSE GOD IS MORE INTERESTED IN YOUR CHARACTER THAN YOUR COMFORT ¤ AUTHOR PATSY CLAREMONT WRITES, “OUR YOUNGEST SON, JASON, HAS TWO GOALS IN LIFE. ONE IS TO HAVE FUN, AND THE OTHER IS TO RELAX. AND HE DOES BOTH VERY WELL. SO I SHOULDN’T HAVE BEEN SURPRISED BY WHAT HAPPENED ONE FALL DAY WHEN I DROPPED HIM OFF AT SCHOOL. I KEPT MYSELF BUSY GETTING READY FOR THE DAY AS JASON HEADED OUT FOR THE BUS. THE KNOCK ON THE DOOR WAS UNEXPECTED AND INTERRUPTED MY MORNING ROUTINE. IT DIDN’T HAPPEN OFTEN. I HURRIED TO THE DOOR, PULLED IT OPEN, AND FOUND MYSELF STARING AT JASON. ‘WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?’ I ASKED. ‘I SKIPPED SCHOOL,’ HE ANNOUNCED. ‘SKIP SCHOOL?’ I REPEATED MY WORDS IN DISBELIEF, MY VOICE LOUD ENOUGH FOR HUMAN EARS. ONCE I BELIEVED, I TRIED TO RECALL SOME MATERNAL PSYCHOLOGY. BUT ALL THAT CAME TO MIND WAS, ‘IF I SOLVE THE PROBLEM RIGHT AWAY, IT CAN SAVE ME A LOT OF EXTRA WORK LATER,’ AND ‘IF EATING MORE IS BENEFICIAL WHEN YOU HAVE A COLD, FASTING OR EATING LESS IS BENEFICIAL WHEN YOU HAVE A FEVER.’ … SOMEHOW, THOSE THINGS DIDN’T SEEM TO APPLY TO A SIX-YEAR-OLD WHO WAS IN THE DILEMMA OF DROPPING OUT. SO I ASKED, ‘WHY DID YOU DROP OUT OF SCHOOL?’ WITHOUT HESITATION, HE DECLARED, ‘IT’S TOO LONG, IT’S TOO HARD, AND IT’S TOO BORING.’ I IMMEDIATELY REPLIED, ‘JASON, YOU’VE JUST DESCRIBED LIFE. ACCEPT THE STRUGGLES OF LIFE AND MOVE ON.’” THE BIBLE SAYS, “IF YOU ENDURE SUFFERING FOR DOING GOOD AND SUFFER, THIS IS COMMENDABLE IN THE SIGHT OF GOD.” SO IF YOU ARE LEARNING THROUGH HARDSHIP, REJOICE. GOD IS TRAINING YOU FOR GREATER AND BETTER THINGS ¤ SO ACCEPT THE STRUGGLES OF LIFE ¤ SPIRITUAL FOOD: SONG OF SOLOMON 5-8 MATTHEW 26:1-16 PSALM 39 PROVERBS 21:9-13</p>
