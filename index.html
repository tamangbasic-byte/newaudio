  <p>Monday, September 15 (Bhadru 30) “How can a young man keep his ways pure? By living according to your word.” —Psalm 119:9 The Bible helps us overcome temptation (5) When we give in to temptation, it is easy to blame other people and our environment. “Women today dress too provocatively . . Men are too sexually aggressive . . . The media is overexposed.” These statements may be true, but they do not help us overcome temptation’s tactics. Comedian Will Rogers is said to have said, “Things are not the same as they used to be, and they probably never were.” When it comes to hindsight, rose-colored glasses can be deceptive. Our enemy Satan has not changed his ways. He still works because human nature has not changed. He learned the hard way that Bathsheba’s bathing routine was not the cause of David’s failure. Taking responsibility for his behavior, he prayed, “For I know my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me. Against you … I have sinned, and done what is evil in your sight” (Psalm 51:3–4). Notice two important lessons David learned: (1) He discovered that forgiveness, restoration, and freedom begin when you repent and take responsibility for your actions. (2) He also learned that the way to maintain power over your sexual nature depends on frequent time spent in God’s Word, not on your own efforts. “How can a young man cleanse his ways?” God’s answer is not mysterious or difficult to understand. His universal solution is, “By living according to your word.” David’s new attitude and purity of heart came from practicing this truth—“Your word I have hidden in my heart, that I might not sin against you” (Psalm 119:11). This is a formula for victory that will work in your life too. Keep your life pure by living according to God's Word.
